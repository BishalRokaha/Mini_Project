# Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing two mini projects developed using Python: a **Café Management System** and a **To-Do List Maker**. These projects demonstrate basic functionalities and serve as a foundation for more complex applications.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Café Management System

The Café Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing orders in a café. This simple console-based application allows users to:

- **Display Menu:** List available items with prices.
- **Case-Insensitive Order Handling:** Accept orders regardless of item name case.
- **Add Items to Order:** Select items and quantities for the order.
- **Handle Unavailable Items:** Notify if an item isn't on the menu.
- **Calculate Total Cost:** Compute the total cost automatically
- **Apply Discount:** Apply a 10% discount for orders over Rs200.
- **Generate Order Summary:** Show a detailed summary of the order.
- **Collect Customer Feedback:** Prompt for customer feedback.
- **Multi-Customer Support:** Handle multiple customers sequentially.
- **Exit System:** Close the app after all orders are completed.
  
### 2. To-Do List Maker

The To-Do List Maker is a command-line application that helps users organize and manage their tasks. The application features:

- **View All Tasks:** Display all tasks with their titles, descriptions, priorities, and statuses.
- **Add New Task:** Create and add a new task to the list with a title, description, priority, and initial status.
- **Update a Task:** Modify the title, description, priority, or status of an existing task.
- **Delete a Task:** Remove a task from the list based on its task number.
- **Exit the App:** Safely close the application after finishing task management.
